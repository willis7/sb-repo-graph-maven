This project is a work in progress and very early in development.

The idea behind this project is to leverage the metadata from your Maven (and eventually Gradle) files to build a graph of dependendies and how they link together. The idea is that you can then search the graph using the popular GAV parameters of Maven to establish the usage of dependencies.
